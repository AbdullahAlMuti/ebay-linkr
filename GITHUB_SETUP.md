# 🚀 Upload to GitHub - Step by Step

## ✅ What's Done So Far:
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All files added to Git
- ✅ Initial commit created (98 files, 15,336 lines!)

## 📋 Next Steps to Upload to GitHub:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com**
   - Login to your GitHub account
   - Click the "+" icon in top right
   - Select "New repository"

2. **Repository Settings:**
   - **Repository name**: `ebay-linkr` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "React + Vite + Supabase application with deployment scripts"
   - **Visibility**: Public (or Private if you prefer)
   - **DON'T** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME

Replace the placeholders with your actual:
- **YOUR_USERNAME**: Your GitHub username
- **YOUR_REPO_NAME**: The repository name you created

### Example:
If your username is `john123` and repo name is `ebay-linkr`:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/john123/ebay-linkr.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication Options:

### Option A: HTTPS (Recommended for beginners)
- Use your GitHub username and password
- Or use Personal Access Token (more secure)

### Option B: SSH (Advanced)
- Requires SSH key setup
- More secure but requires initial configuration

## 🎯 After Upload:

Your repository will contain:
- ✅ Complete React + Vite application
- ✅ Supabase integration
- ✅ Deployment scripts for Hostinger
- ✅ Netlify configuration
- ✅ Development workflow guides
- ✅ All UI components and styling

## 🚀 Future Workflow:

After uploading, your workflow becomes:
```bash
# Make changes locally
npm run dev

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature X"
git push

# Deploy to Hostinger (if needed)
deploy-to-hostinger.bat
```
